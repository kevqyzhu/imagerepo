# 2021 Shopify Developer Intern Challenge

 This program is my entry for the backend developer challenge! You are able to create your own account, giving you a personal image repository. 
 From there, you can add and delete images as well as search for images by keywords.
 
### How to run it:
Have python3 installed and clone this project. In the imagerepo directory, run `python3 manage.py runserver`
Then, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your web browser.
